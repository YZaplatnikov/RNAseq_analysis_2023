The project explores Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), a rare genetic disorder caused by SUMF1 mutations. Study is focused on retinoids like adapalene and tazarotene to enhance sulfatase activity and improve cellular function. Utilizing RNA sequencing, the study demonstrates how tazarotene offers a promising therapeutic approach for MSD.
